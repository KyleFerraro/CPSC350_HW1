# CPSC350-HW1

### Student ID: 230544

This assignment was used to determine the efficiency of non-primitive data structures by not being allowed to use them. 

### Resources:
- I used the zyBook for CPSC 298 and used mainly the "9.5 File input" and "9.7 File output" in order to determine how to pull form and push to new .txt files.
- I also used cplusplus.com for simple opperations, such as determining characters in a file, reading characters in a file and manipulating them.

### The Downside:
Unfortunately, I was not able to complete this assignment in full. I was not able to properly import a file from the user, so my code is not able to run/compile properly with g++. I intend to continue working on this assignment to fix my issues even though I should have solved this problem early on in the process.
